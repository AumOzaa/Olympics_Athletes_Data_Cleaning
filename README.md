## Project Overview

The Olympics Athletes dataset includes various details about athletes, such as their names, countries, sports, medals won, and participation years. Raw datasets often contain missing values, inconsistent formats, and irrelevant columns, which can affect the quality of any subsequent analysis.

This project focuses on:

- Handling missing or null values
- Correcting inconsistent data entries
- Removing duplicates
- Formatting columns for better usability
- Generating meaningful summary statistics after cleaning
